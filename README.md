i finished the landing page, it took me longer than a week because i got stuck fixing the width of the background being affected when i am setting a width for the body. the solution is that i have to take the background out of the container itself and make it at the body instead to not get affected by the width of the container. i have learned a lot from doing this project, this landing page is not perfect but i will be back and make this better once i get better and have more understanding of web development. i had a lot of fun doing this and i am looking forward for more projects that i have to do here in Odin project.
